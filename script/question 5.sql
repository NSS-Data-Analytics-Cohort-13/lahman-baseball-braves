 -- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.


 SELECT SUM(PO) AS total_putouts,
	  (CASE WHEN pos ILIKE 'OF' THEN 'outfield '
	  WHEN pos IN ('SS','1B','2B','3B') THEN 'infield'
	  WHEN pos  IN  ('P','C') THEN 'Battery'
	  END) AS Position
	  FROM fielding 
	 
	  WHERE yearid = 2016 AND pos IS NOT NULL
	  GROUP BY Position

-- 5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?	  

SELECT yearid/10*10 AS decade,
ROUND(((SUM(SO)::float / SUM(g))::numeric),2) AS average_so,
ROUND(((SUM(hr)::float / SUM(g))::numeric),2) AS average_hr
FROM teams
WHERE yearid >= 1920
GROUP BY decade

ORDER BY decade
